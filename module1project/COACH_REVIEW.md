# Coach Review / Feedback

This file contains the coach review for the **first module's project**.

## Overview

The project you have sent is missing most of the features. It's good you managed to conclude the create feature, but you need to take more time to understand what we're doing. The delete and update student features are crucial for you to understand. Please, let me know if you need help.

## Project Attended Requestes

Below, I've listed some of the tasks you've done that were required in the project and some that were good to have.

## Bugs

:bug: There are no buttons to update or delete.

:bug: I see some error messages when listing more than one student.

## To Improve

These improvements are optional to implement now. In any case, please remember to pay attention to it in future projects. Here are a few topics you can improve:

1. You should complete all the project's required features. If you feel it's too complicated, check the To-Do List we have created with no JavaScript; it's easier to understand. Also, do not hesitate to ask for help.

## Project Grade

Please don't be attached to this project grade. It's just a way for you to know how you're doing based on the project requirements, compare to the other students, and keep moving/improving as we go. The grading is from 1 to 10.

:memo: **Grade: 5**

*This grade means there are many things to improve, but let's keep going and do better in future projects! :rocket:*

## What's Next

Keep practicing, paying attention to the lessons, reviewing the contents, and doing more than required. Use this feedback for future projects.
